    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "- Begin with a provocative question written on the board:  \n",
      "  *\"What if humanity fought a war on Mars in the year 2076?\"*\n",
      "- Briefly introduce the concept of the Martian War of 2076. Provide the students with a fictional backstory to set the stage:  \n",
      "  > In the late 21st century, humanity had established colonies on Mars. As Earth's resources dwindled, tensions arose over Martian independence, resource ownership, and technological dominance. By 2076, these tensions erupted into what is now known as the Martian War.\n",
      "- Explain that the lesson will combine science fiction with real-world science and history to explore this scenario.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Historical Context Brainstorm (15 minutes)**  \n",
      "- Distribute a fictional **timeline of events leading to the Martian War of 2076** (sample below):  \n",
      "  **Timeline Handout:**  \n",
      "  - 2035: The first manned mission to Mars successfully lands.  \n",
      "  - 2050: Permanent human settlements are established on Mars.  \n",
      "  - 2060: Discovery of valuable minerals and water sources beneath the Martian surface sparks economic interest.  \n",
      "  - 2065: Tensions rise as Martian settlers demand independence from Earth's governments, claiming self-sufficiency and sovereignty.  \n",
      "  - 2076: A coalition of Earth nations sends military forces to Mars to maintain control, sparking the Martian War.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Lead a class discussion on:  \n",
      "  - What real-world events in history mirror these tensions? (e.g., American Revolution, scramble for resources in Africa, Space Race)  \n",
      "  - What challenges might arise in governing an interplanetary colony? (e.g., communication delays, cultural differences, economic disputes)  \n",
      "  - How could technology, such as AI or autonomous weapons, play a role in this conflict?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Group Activity: Designing Mars in 2076 (20 minutes)**  \n",
      "- Divide students into small groups and assign each group one aspect of Martian society to develop in detail, imagining how it might look in 2076. Examples include:  \n",
      "  - Government: What political structure governs Mars?  \n",
      "  - Technology: What tools or weapons are used in the war?  \n",
      "  - Culture: How do the people of Mars identify themselves (e.g., \"Martians\" vs. \"Earthlings\")?  \n",
      "  - Environment: How does Mars' harsh landscape shape the war's strategies and outcomes?  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Each group will create a **short presentation or poster** describing their vision of Mars during the war.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Creative Writing Exercise: \"A Day in 2076\" (10 minutes)**  \n",
      "- Have students imagine they are living during the Martian War of 2076. Ask them to write a brief diary entry or news article describing a day's events from their perspective. Prompts:   \n",
      "  - Are you a soldier? A civilian? A journalist?   \n",
      "  - Where are you: a Martian colony, Earth's headquarters, or a spaceship in orbit?  \n",
      "  - How do you feel about the war?  \n",
